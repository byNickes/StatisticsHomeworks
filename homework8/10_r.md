### Distributions of the order statistics: look on the web for the most simple (but still rigorous) and clear derivations of the distributions, explaining in your own words the methods used.

Before talking about the distributions of the order statistics let's see some notation.

Let X1, X2,..., Xn be a random sample of size n from some distribution. We denote the order statistics by

In what follows, we will derive the distributions and joint distributions for each of these statistics
and groups of these statistics.

**The distribution of the minimum**\
Suppose that X1, X2,...,Xn is a random sample from a continuous distribution with pdf f and cdf F. We will now derive the pdf for X(1), the minimum value of the sample. The game plan will be to relate the cdf of the minimum to the behavior of the individual sampled values X1, X2,..., Xn for which we know the pdf and cdf.

The CDF for the minimum is

Now imagine a random sample falling in such a way that the minimum is below a fixed value x. It might
look like this

or this

This means that

There are many ways for the individual Xi to fall so that the minimum is less than or equal to x. On the other hand, the minimum is greater than x if and only if all the Xi are greater than x.

So, it's easier to consider P(X(1) ≤ x) as the complementary of P(X(1) > x). Thus, we obtain the following result:

Since the PDF is the derivative of the CDF, then, from the CDF of the minimum, we can derive the PDF as follows

**The distribution of the maximum**\
Again consider our random sample X1, X2,..., Xn from a continuous distribution with PDF f and
CDF F. We will now derive the pdf for X(n), the maximum value of the sample. As with the minimum, we will consider the cdf and try to relate it to the behavior of the individual sampled values X1, X2,..., Xn. 

Imagine a random sample falling in such a way that the maximum is below a fixed value x. This
will happen if and only if all of the Xi are below x.

Then, we have that

As before we can obtain the PDF as the derivative of the CDF
