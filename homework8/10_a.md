**UniformRVGenerator**\
This class is as it was in the past homework but the GetValue function has been changed to fit the scope of the current homework.\
Every value sampled from a U(0,1) is approximated by two digits. This has been done because, if all the digits are kept, then are needed many more samples to converge to a beta distribution for the minimum and maximum order statistics distribution. Thanks to this approximation, the probability of collision is much higher without changing the probability of getting a value with U(0,1), so we are still sampling from an uniform distribution. 
{% highlight C# %}
public double GetValue()
{
    return Math.Round(r.NextDouble(),2);
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

**Main and other classes**\
The class LinePlotter and Histogram are as they were in past homework, what changed is the main. Below can be found the main changes made to the main.

Below there's the computation of the sample mean for m sequences of n values sampled from an uniform random variable. Then, the distribution of the sample mean is plotted as usual by using the Histogram class.
{% highlight C# %}
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
{
    double mean = 0;
    values.Add(new List<double>());
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        double v = n_g.GetValue();
        values[i].Add(v);
        mean += (v - mean) / (j+1);
    }
    means.Add(mean);
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

In the next block of code it's taken the lower value for any sequence of sample and it's stored in a list. In the meanwhile the distribution of the first order statistics is computed.
{% highlight C# %}
//get first order statistics
List<double> first_stat = new List<double>();
Dictionary<double, int> d_first = new Dictionary<double, int>();
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
{
    double add = values[i][0];
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        if (values[i][j] < add) add = values[i][j];
    }
    first_stat.Add(add);

    //to compute the distribution of first order statistics
    if (d_first.Keys.Contains(add)) d_first[add]++;
    else d_first[add] = 1;
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

In the code below it's taken the higher value for any sequence of sample. In the meanwhile the distribution of the last order statistics is computed.
{% highlight C# %}
//get last statistics
List<double> last_stat = new List<double>();
Dictionary<double, int> d_last = new Dictionary<double, int>();
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
{
    double add = -1;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        if (values[i][j] > add) add = values[i][j];
    }
    last_stat.Add(add);

    //to compute the distribution of first order statistics
    if (d_last.Keys.Contains(add)) d_last[add]++;
    else d_last[add] = 1;
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

Below it's available the code that prepares the paths representing the distributions of the first order statistics and last order statistics. They are plotted using the LinePlotter class. It has been chosen to plot those two distributions in the same chart to highlight the similarity between the two and their belonging to the Beta distribution.
{% highlight C# %}
List<double> k1 = d_first.Keys.ToList();
k1.Sort();
List<double> k2 = d_last.Keys.ToList();
k2.Sort();

List<PointF> p_first = new List<PointF>();
p_first.Add(new PointF(0, 0));
for(int i = 0; i < k1.Count; i++)
{
    p_first.Add(new PointF((float)k1[i], ((float)d_first[k1[i]] / ((float)m))));
}
p_first.Add(new PointF(p_first[k1.Count].X, 0));
p_first.Add(new PointF(1, 0));

List<PointF> p_last = new List<PointF>();
p_last.Add(new PointF(0, 0));
for (int i = 0; i < k2.Count; i++)
{
    if (i == 0) p_last.Add(new PointF((float)k2[i], 0));
    p_last.Add(new PointF((float)k2[i], ((float)d_last[k2[i]])/((float)m)));
}
p_last.Add(new PointF(1, 0));
{% endhighlight C# %}
