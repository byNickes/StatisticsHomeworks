## Research (11_R)
### Do a research about the general correlation coefficient for ranks and the most common indices that can be derived by it.
A correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of some type of correlation, meaning a statistical relationship between two variables. The variables may be two columns of a given data set of observations, often called a sample, or two components of a multivariate random variable with a known distribution.\
Several types of correlation coefficient exist, each with their own definition and own range of usability and characteristics.

We want to talk about **rank correlation coefficients**.

In statistics, a rank correlation is any of several statistics that measure an ordinal association that is the relationship between rankings of different ordinal variables or different rankings of the same variable. A "ranking" is the assignment of the ordering labels "first", "second", "third", etc. to different observations of a particular variable.

Any correlation coefficient, and so also any rank correlation coefficient, is inside the inverval [-1, 1] and assumes the value:

‚Ä¢ 1 if the agreement between the two rankings is perfect; the two rankings are the same.

‚Ä¢ 0 if the rankings are completely independent.

‚Ä¢ ‚àí1 if the disagreement between the two rankings is perfect; one ranking is the reverse of the other.

Let's see now some kind of rank correlation coefficients.

**General Correlation coefficient**\
Suppose we have a set of n objects, which are being considered in relation to two properties, represented by x and y, forming the sets of values {x·µ¢}, for i ‚â§ n, and {y·µ¢}, for i ‚â§ n,. To any pair of individuals, say the i-th and the j-th we assign a x-score, denoted by a·µ¢‚±º, and a y-score, denoted by b·µ¢‚±º.\
The only requirement for these functions is that they be anti-symmetric, so a·µ¢‚±º = - a‚±º·µ¢ and b·µ¢‚±º = - b‚±º·µ¢.\

Then the generalized correlation coefficient is defined as

**Kendall's ùúè as a particular case**\
If r·µ¢, s·µ¢ are the ranks of the i-member according to the x-quality and y-quality respectively, then we can define

**Spearman's œÅ as a particular case**\
If r·µ¢, s·µ¢ are the ranks of the i-member according to the x and the y-quality respectively, we can simply define

Then we have:
