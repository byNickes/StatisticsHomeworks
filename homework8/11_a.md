**BernoulliRVGenerator**\
This class is mostly as it has been presented in past homework. Although, the next 2 functions have been added to the class since they were requested to solve this homework.\

The next function computes the distance of each success from the origin and adds it to a list, used to compute the distribution of the distances. The list "values" is a list of lists where each list is a sample path. The position j reflects the order in which a value has been sampled and so it is the distance from the origin.
{% highlight C# %}
public List<double> getFromOriginDistances()
{
    List<double> distances = new List<double>();

    for (int i = 0; i < values.Count; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < values[i].Count; j++)
        {
            if (values[i][j] == 1)
            {
                distances.Add(j);
            }
        }
    }

    return distances;
}
{% endhighlight %}
The getConsecutiveDistances function computes the distance from a success and the nearest previous distance. The list "values" is defined as before. Everytime I have a success I compute the distance from the previous one, I add it to the list of distances and I update the previous with the current success.
{% highlight C# %}
public List<double> getConsecutiveDistances()
{
    List<double> distances = new List<double>();

    for (int i = 0; i < values.Count; i++)
    {
        int previous = 0;
        bool firstCase = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < values[i].Count; j++)
        {
            if (values[i][j] == 1)
            {
                if (!firstCase)
                {
                    distances.Add(j - previous);
                }
                else
                {
                    firstCase = false;
                }

                previous = j;

            }
        }
    }

    return distances;
}
