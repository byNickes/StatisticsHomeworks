To code this application has been used a timer that, at every tick, activates an handler who draws again the two rectangles according to the new dimensions and coordinates. 
Any rectangle is an object MovedRectangle defined by me. It has the job to handle events such as click on the picture box or the pressing of left CTRL button on the keyboard.\
To move a rectangle is enough to press left mouse when the cursor is into the bounds of the rectangle and drag it, to resize it is also needed to press left CTRL.\
The class MovableRectangle is made as following:
```C#
class MovableRectangle
{
    public Rectangle r;
    PictureBox pb;
    Form form;

    public MovableRectangle(int x, int y, int w, int h, PictureBox pb_in, Form form_in)
    {
        r = new Rectangle(x, y, w, h);
        pb = pb_in;
        form = form_in;

        pb.MouseMove += new MouseEventHandler(pictureBox_Move);
        pb.MouseUp += new MouseEventHandler(pictureBox_MouseUp);
        pb.MouseDown += new MouseEventHandler(pictureBox_MouseDown);

        form.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler(Form_KeyDown);
        form.KeyUp += new KeyEventHandler (Form_KeyUp);
    }

    Boolean button_pressed = false;
    Boolean ctrl_pressed = false;
    int x;
    int y;

    void Form_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Control)
        {
            ctrl_pressed = true;
        }
    }

    void Form_KeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        ctrl_pressed = false;
    }

    int start_w;
    int start_h;
    void pictureBox_Move(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        MouseEventArgs me = (MouseEventArgs)e;
        Point m_p = me.Location;
        if (button_pressed && r.Contains(m_p) && !ctrl_pressed)
        {
            r.X = e.X + x;
            r.Y = e.Y + y;
        }
        else if (button_pressed && r.Contains(m_p) && ctrl_pressed)
        {
            int temp_w = 0;
            int temp_h = 0;

            temp_w = start_w + (e.X - x);
            temp_h = start_h + (e.Y - y);

            if (temp_w > 10) {
                r.Width = temp_w;
            }
            if (temp_h > 10) {
                r.Height = temp_h;
            }
        }
    }

    void pictureBox_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        button_pressed = true;
        MouseEventArgs me = (MouseEventArgs)e;
        Point m_p = me.Location;
        if (r.Contains(m_p) && !ctrl_pressed)
        {
            x = r.X - e.X;
            y = r.Y - e.Y;
        }
        else if(r.Contains(m_p) && ctrl_pressed)
        {
            x = e.X;
            y = e.Y;
            start_w = r.Width;
            start_h = r.Height;
        }
    }

    void pictureBox_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        button_pressed = false;
    }

}
```
From the code can be seen that the new coordinates are computed as shown in the next block where the variable e has been differentiated in case it holds the event of a click or the event of moving the mouse:
```C#
x = r.X - e_click.X;
y = r.Y - e_click.Y;

r.X = e_move.X + x;
r.Y = e_move.Y + y;
```
X and y are the distance between the upper-left edge of the rectangle and the place where the user clicked the left button, instead r.X and r.Y are the new coordinates since
```
r.X = e_move.X + x = e_move.X + r.X - e_click.X
```
and e_move.X - e_click.X is the distance that has been travelled by the mouse since left click has been pressed, it tells how much the user wants to move the rectangle.\
In the next block is available the computation of the new size of the rectangle which follows the same principle:
```C#
x = e.X;
y = e.Y;
start_w = r.Width;
start_h = r.Height;

temp_w = start_w + (e.X - x);
temp_h = start_h + (e.Y - y);
```
