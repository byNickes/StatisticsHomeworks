## Research (2_R)
### Describe the most common configuration of data repositories in the real world and corporate environment. Concepts such as Operational or Transactional systems (OLTP), Data Warehouse DW, Data Marts, Analytical and statistical systems (OLAP), etc. Try to draw a conceptual picture of how all these components may work together and how the flow of data and information is processed to extract useful knowledge from raw data.

Most common configuration of data repositories used by every corporation has these main components:

***1-*** OLTP \
***2-*** Data Stream \
***3-*** Data Lake \
***4-*** Data Swamp \
***5-*** Data Warehouse \
***6-*** Data Mart \
***7-*** OLAP \

OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing, it is a set of software techniques used to make transactions on databases. A transaction could be updating, inserting, and/or deleting some data. Data generated by OLTP systems are seen as a Data Stream which converges in a so called Data Lake.\
A Data Lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data. This simplifies the storage since is possible to store data as it arrives from the Data Stream. From Data Lake converges data arriving from any application of the corporation that owns it, has can be seen in the next image.

So a Data Lake stores relational and non-relational data where the structure of the data or schema where they are contained is not defined. This means that is possible to store all data without design carefully a database. Data contained in a Data Lake will eventually flow in Data Warehouses, when needed, to be organized and used. \
A Data Warehouse, like a Data Lake, is a centralized repository but it is optimized to analyze data. This means that here the schema in which data is contained is well defined to optimize data analysis as needed. Data is transferred from Data Lake to Data Warehouse following a process called ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) that organizes the data according to the schema defined in the Data Warehouse.
