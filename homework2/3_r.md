### Show how we can obtain an online algo for the arithmetic mean and explain the various possible reasons why it is preferable to the "naive" algo based on the definition.
In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is the sum of a set of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the set, the arithmetic mean formula is the following: \

Using this formula in an online algorithm for arithmetic mean can create problems related to overflow errors caused by numerical representation, furthermore, it could use an unbounded amount of memory since we need to store any value we receive, and they could be infinite. \
Unbounded memory is needed because everytime we need to compute the whole mean, whenever a new value arrives, this means that summing every value again is needed and to do so we have to store any value received. Overflow errors occurs because we keep summing values and, at some point, we will reach the maximum representable number and the computation will be completely wrong. \
It's possible to apply the so called "naive" formula that is as following: \

This formula solves the need of an unbounded amount of memory since it's no more needed to store the whole set of received values and it requires less time to be calculated since it's no more needed to sum every value again. But, we still have the overflow problem. \
The solution of both issues is the Knuth Formula that is obtained as following: \

This way is possible to use the mean computed in the previous step and update it with the new value without any of the two problems mentioned before.
