## Research (1_R)
### Give your best description of the many reaching out of statistics, in its various form, as a branch of math (Probability theory, etc.), as a set of methodologies used in many other disciplines, as an essential tool to deal with any sort of data, make reports and provide governance tools. What is the role of Statistics in Math and Science?
Statistics has many branches and each of it is used in many fields.\
Descriptive statistics is often used to synthesize social and scientifics phenomenon in business, health care and many more activities. In the last two years, during a pandemic, it has been very useful to study how infection was progressing through the population. This is thanks to the techniques used to organize a big amount of data in a more readable form. This way, scientists, can focus on how to deal with the problem without loosing time at understanding the dimension of it, thanks to the clear exposition of data.  Descriptive statistics requires that data are acquired observing reality. In this case the phenomenon is well known and documented, but what if it's not possible to have precise data?\
Inferential statistics helps out to understand not well documented problems studying, with descriptive statistics, a subset of the set of statistical units of which I can get precise data. Using methods of inferential statistics I can then derive conclusions on the whole set of statistical units. This is a branch of Mathematical Statistics that aims to describe phenomenon of which I don't have precise data. These techniques are quite useful in cases where it's impossible to get enough sample to describe correctly a scientific event. Statistics is also quite used in scientific fields to estimate the error of some measurements, for complex problems is not always possible to define a sure solution. For this probability theory is quite important since makes possible to make conclusions on random phenomenon, assuming to know the probability of an even to happen.

### Discuss whether it can be considered a "science" and what is the "scientific method" (what is a "theory" and what is a "hypothesis").
Statistics is more a tool for science than science itself. In fact, statistics have vericity but they are subject to error. Mathematical statistics is a branch of Maths but those methodologies are applied to data that can't be considered always 100% representive of what I want to make conclusions of. Also, probability theory is a part of statistics methodologies and, even this branch, can't be considered a science since its results can't be proved without considering errors. In fact, it's impossible to apply scientific method to all fields of Statistics. The scientific method consists in making an hypothesis, testing it with experiments, analyzing results and then exposing conclusions. If the hypothesis is supported by empirical evidences, then it becomes a theory. As already said, this is impossible to apply to any branches of Statistics so, also for this, for me Statistics can't be considered a science.
## Application (1_A)
**[Press here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/146lz_b4jEahGEgQvEOlwN5E4a-8d3i3q/view?usp=sharing)** to download the zip that contains the application.

The animation has been made using a timer to trigger an event at each tick (one every 20 ms). When the timer timeouts, the handler increases or decreases both x and y position of the two balls. If the ball touches one of the edges the movement inverts.
Talking about the text appearing pressing a button, to make it has been used an event handler that triggers when "Show text" button is pressed.
A video of the application running can be watched down below:
