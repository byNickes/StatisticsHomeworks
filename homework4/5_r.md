## Research (5_R)
### Explain a unified conceptual framework to obtain all most common measures of central tendency using the concept of distance (or “premetric” in general). Discuss why it is useful to discuss these concepts introducing the notion of distance.
The measures of central tendency are part of so called Summary Statistics. These measures identify a single value as representative of an entire distribution. This single value is chosen considering the concept of distance.

For example, the arithmetic mean, which is a measure of central tendency, chooses as summary value the one that minimizes the sum of squared deviations from all the values of the variable, in symbols: d(xᵢ, x̄)². In this case the distance is defined as follow:

```
d(xᵢ, x̄) = xᵢ-x̄
```

where x̄ is the arithmetic mean. 

So to obtain a measure of central tendency, first of all, it's needed to define what we mean with distance. After that we need to decide what property we want to satisfy with the summary value relatively to the distance.

Let's now see this conceptual procedure to define the median. \
It is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of the values of a variable.\
In the sequence 
```
1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 
```
the median is 6. To obtain it the sequence of the values must be ordered.\
This value can be defined considering the distance as the one that minimizes the sum of d(xᵢ, M) where M is the median and the distance is defined, equally to the arithmetic mean, as:


```
d(xᵢ, M) = xᵢ-M
```


### Finally, point out the difference between the mathematical definition of "distance" and the properties of the "premetrics" useful in statistics, pointing out trhe most important distances, indexes and similarity measures used in statistics, data analysis and machine learning (such as for instance; Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Manhattan distance, Hamming distance, Cosine distance, Chebishev distance, Jaccard index, Haversine distance, Sørensen-Dice index, etc.).
