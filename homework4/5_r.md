## Research (5_R)
### Explain a possibly unified conceptual framework to obtain all most common measures of central tendency and of dispersion using the concept of distance (or "premetric", or similarity in general). Discuss why it is useful to discuss these concepts introducing the notion of distance. Finally, point out the difference between the mathematical definition of "distance" and the properties of the "premetrics" useful in statistics, pointing out trhe most important distances, indexes and similarity measures used in statistics, data analysis and machine learning (such as for instance; Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Manhattan distance, Hamming distance, Cosine distance, Chebishev distance, Jaccard index, Haversine distance, Sørensen-Dice index, etc.).
