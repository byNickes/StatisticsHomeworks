### Explain what are marginal, joint and conditional distributions and how we can explain the Bayes theorem using relative frequencies.
A ***joint distribution*** is done considering two or more statistical variables, in the case of two variables it is called bivariate distribution. \
The joint distribution for X, Y, ... is defined as how many statistical units of a population falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variables. \
In the next table can be found an example where it's reported a bivariate distribution with relative frequencies instead of absolute values. For instance, in position (0,0), there's the relative frequency of statistical units that has X=Red and Y=Red.

To compute the joint relative frequency for any tuple of values that some statistical variable acquires, it's needed to count how many statistical units have those values for the variables and divide it for the number of statistical units of the population.

The ***marginal distribution*** can be obainted in the example already showed by summing the values of a row for the marginal distribution of X and the values of columns for the marginal distribution of Y. It's in called marginal distribution because it is usually represented in the margins of the table as shown below.

F(X) is the relative frequency associated to any values that a statistical unit can acquire of the variable X. F(Y) can be defined as the same but reated to variable Y. \
This concept can be extended to any dimension of the joint distribution of which we want to compute the marginals distributions. It can be done by fixing a value of the variable of which we want to compute the marginal and sum the relative frequencies associated to it for any values of other not fixed variables. \

The ***conditional distribution***
