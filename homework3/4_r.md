### Explain what are marginal, joint and conditional distributions and how we can explain the Bayes theorem using relative frequencies.
A ***joint distribution*** is done considering two or more statistical variables, in the case of two variables it is called bivariate distribution. \
The joint distribution for X, Y, ... is defined as how many statistical units of a population falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variables. \
In the next table can be found an example where it's reported a bivariate distribution with relative frequencies instead of absolute values. For instance, in position (0,0), there's the relative frequency of statistical units that has X=Red and Y=Red.

To compute the joint relative frequency for any tuple of values that some statistical variable acquires, it's needed to count how many statistical units have those values for the variables and divide it for the number of statistical units of the population.
