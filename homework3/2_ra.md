## Research about application(2_RA)
### Do a review about charts useful for statistics and data presentation.
***Line chart:*** is represented by a group of data points joined together by a straight line. These charts are easy to create and they reveal data trends clearly. It's easy to understand the relation between variable in X-axis and Y-axis. For example if the line always descends when the value on the X-axis grow then we know that Y decreases when X increases so, line charts are able to show relationships more clearly than tables do.\
This type of chart is often used to represent the evolution of a variable during time, an example of a line chart is in the next image.

***Bar chart:*** is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent and they can be plotted vertically or horizontally. At least one of the two values represented in the chart has to be discrete, usually the other one is categorical. \
In the next example in the horizontal axis is represented categorical data while in the vertical axis is represented discrete data (name of the country).

This chart summarizes a large amount of data in an understandable form and it easily accessible to a wide audience.

***Pie chart:*** A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice, is proportional to the quantity it represents. Every slice is related to a value of the variable represented in the chart. \
Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and the mass media since they are graphically appealing and simple to read, but they have been criticized as it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. \
In the next image there is an example where it's represented the numerosity of English native speaker per country.

***Tag cloud:*** A tag cloud is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites or into text files. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color. This format is useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms to determine its relative prominence. \
An example of tag cloud can be seen in the next image.

### What is the chart type that impressed you most and why?
The line chart impressed me the most since, for me, it's the most communicative one. It tells immediately the trend of a value and the relation between two values. So, in a short glimpse it gives many informations.
