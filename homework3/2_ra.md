### Do a review about charts useful for statistics and data presentation.
***Line chart:*** is represented by a group of data points joined together by a straight line. These charts are easy to create and they reveal data trends clearly. It's easy to understand the relation between variable in X-axis and Y-axis. For example if the line always descends when the value on the X-axis grow then we know that Y decreases when X increases.
Line charts compare two variables: one is plotted along the X-axis (horizontal) and the other along the Y-axis (vertical).

### What is the chart type that impressed you most and why?
