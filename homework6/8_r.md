## Research (8_R)
### Do a research about the law of large numbers LLN and the various definitions of convergence.
Before explaining the Law of Large Numbers we need to know what the convergence of random variables is.

**Convergence in distribution**\
Convergence in distribution is in some sense the weakest type of convergence. All it says is that the CDF of the sequence of random variables Xn converges to the CDF of X as n goes to infinity. It does not require any dependence between the sequence Xn and X.

Here is a formal definition of convergence in distribution:

**Convergence in probability**\
Convergence in probability is stronger than convergence in distribution. In particular, for a sequence X1, X2, X3,... to converge to a random variable X, we must have that P(|Xn−X|≥ϵ) goes to 0 as n→∞, for any ϵ>0.

Here is the formal definition of convergence in probability:

**Almost sure convergence**\
Almost sure convergence is the strongest type of convergence.

The definition is as following:\
To say that the sequence Xn converges almost surely or almost everywhere or with probability 1 or strongly towards X means that

This means that the values of Xn approach the value of X, in the sense that events for which Xn does not converge to X have probability 0. \
Almost sure convergence is often denoted by adding the letters a.s. over an arrow indicating convergence as shown below.

### Do a research about the convergence of the Binomial to the normal and Poisson distributions.

###  Do a research about the central limit theorem.
