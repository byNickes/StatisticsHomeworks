### Explain the Bayes Theorem and its key role in statistical induction.
In the research 4_R we have seen the Bayes theorem explained with relative frequencies. Since relative frequencies are the realization of the theoretical concept of probability, the Bayes theorem works also for probability. \
It says that the conditional probability P(A | B) can be calculated with the following formula:

In statistical induction we have an empirical distribution, that has been obtained by observing a phenomenon, and a family of probability distribution. An example of family can be the family of normal distributions. Every member of the family can be obtained by changing, for instance, variance or mean. The parameters that can be set to pick a specific member of the family are contained in a vector called ***state of nature*** and its symbol is Θ. \
If we call E the empirical distribution we have that, in statistical induction, we are interested in knowing P(Θ | E). It is the probability that, knowing E, it was generated by a member of the familty distribution that has as values of the parameters the ones contained in Θ. \
The Bayes theorem comes handy to calculate this probability since:

where\
•P(Θ) is the prior probability, it is the probability that Θ is the state of nature that generated E before that E is observed. \
•P(Θ | E) is the posterior probability. As already explained it is the probability that Θ generated E knowing E. \
•P(E | Θ) is called "likelihood of Θ", it is the probability that E is generated by Θ.\
•P(E) is the sum of the joint probability of E with any possible Θ since E can be generated by any of them.

### Describe the different paradigms that can be found within statistical inference (such as"bayesian", "frequentist" [Fisher, Neyman]).
