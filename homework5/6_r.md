### Think and explain in your own words what is the role that probability plays in Statistics and the relation between the observed distribution and their "theoretical" counterparts. 
In descriptive statistics we don't have any random event that could occur. We just assume to have a dataset that comes from an observation of a phenomenon and we want to summarize and represent data.\
When probability is considered then we are assuming to have some random events and, for each of it, we want to determine how likely that event will occur. \
So, probability is a branch of mathematics that concers the numerical description of how likely an event is to occur while statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.\
The probability theory becomes a tool used in statistics when doing inferenctial statistics: we want to obtain a distribution of some variables for a sample when starting from an empirical distribution obtained by observing a real population that is contained into the sample. So, by observing a real population, we make conclusions on a bigger set of statistical units of which we can't make real observations. We are deriving conclusions of something we don't know by processing what we know. 



### Do some practical examples where you explain how the concepts of an abstract probability space relate to more "concrete" and "real-world" objects when doing statistics.
