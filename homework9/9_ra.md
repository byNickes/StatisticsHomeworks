## Research about application(9_RA)
### Try to find on the web what are the names of the random variables that you just simulated in the applications, and see if the means and variances that you obtain in the simulation are compatible with the "theory". If not fix the possible bugs.
Below are listed the names and characteristics of the variables we have computed in the 13_A application.

**Log-normal distribution**\
A log-normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.\
Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution. Equivalently, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution.\
A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values.

*Generation and parameters*
Let Z be a standard normal variable, and let μ and σ>0 be two real numbers. Then, the distribution of the random variable

is called the log-normal distribution with parameters μ and σ.\
The mean of this distribution is

The variance is
