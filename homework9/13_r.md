### An "analog" of the CLT for stochastic process: the standard Wiener process as "scaling limit" of a random walk and the functional CLT (Donsker theorem) or invariance principle. Explain the intuitive meaning of this result and how you have already illustrated the result in your homework.

The Wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic process with stationary independent increments. Like the random walk constructed by Rademacher’s random variables, the Wiener process (as the one we constructed for instance by normal random variables multiplied by σ parameter and by the number of steps) returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often (only in 2 dimensions).

The Donsker theorem says the following.\
Let X₁,X₂,X₃,... be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with mean 0.
Let Sₙ be as follows:

We can define the stochastic process  S = Sₙ where n ∈ N is known as a random walk. We define the diffusively rescaled random walk as

The CLT says that W⁽ⁿ⁾(1) converges in distribution to a standard Gaussian random variable W(1) as n tends to infinity.

The Donker’s invariance principle extends this convergence to the whole function W⁽ⁿ⁾(t). More precisely: as random variables taking values in the Skorokhod space D[0, 1], the random function W⁽ⁿ⁾(t) converges in distribution to a standard Wiener process as n tends to infinity.

**What is a Càdlàg and the Skorokhod space?**\
In mathematics, a càdlàg function is a function defined on the real numbers (or a subset of them) that is everywhere right-continuous and has left limits everywhere.

The collection of càdlàg functions on a given domain is known as Skorokhod space.

**Illustration of this concept in the homework**\
We have seen it in the application 9_A_2.\
We can see that the distribution of the values taken by the simple walk, at each instant, converges to a N(0,1) which is the distribution of the increments of a Wiener process. This is just what the Donker's invariance principle says.
