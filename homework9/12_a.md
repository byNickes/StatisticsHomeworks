The paths and the histograms are plotted as in the previous homework. What is interesting are the functions related to the generation of the values.\
The GetValue function generates the value using a Normal distribution, it is obtained by transforming two Uniform random variables with the Box-Muller transformation.
{% highlight C# %}
public double GetValue()
{
    double u1 = r.NextDouble();
    double u2 = r.NextDouble();
    return Math.Sqrt(-2 * Math.Log(u1))*Math.Cos(2*Math.PI*u2);
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

The values generated by the GetValue function are then put in a list, ready to be represented.
{% highlight C# %}
public List<List<PointF>> GetJumpsPaths(int n, int m, int scale)
{
    List<List<PointF>> res = new List<List<PointF>>();

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        List<PointF> path = new List<PointF>();
        double pos = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            pos += scale*GetValue()*Math.Sqrt(1/((double)(n)));
            path.Add(new PointF(j, (float)pos));
        }
        res.Add(path);
    }

    return res;
}
{% endhighlight C# %}

In this application we are representing a Wiener process where, the random variables summed, are distributed as a N(0,1). It's possible to see on the histograms that the increments are distributed as a Normal distribution more the value n increases.\
What happens in this application is what the Donsker's theorem tells. 
                              
The video of the application can be found below.
