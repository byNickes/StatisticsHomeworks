The animation has been made using a timer to trigger an event at each tick (one every 20 ms). When the timer timeouts, the handler increases or decreases both x and y position of the two balls. If the ball touches one of the edges the movement inverts.
Talking about the text appearing pressing a button, to make it has been used an event handler that triggers when "Show text" button is pressed.
A video of the application running can be watched down below:
