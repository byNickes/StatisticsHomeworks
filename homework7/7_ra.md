### Do a research about the random walk process and its properties.
In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.

An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or −1 with equal probability.\
In the simplest context the walk is in discrete time, that is a sequence of random variables (Xₜ) = (X₁, X₂, ...) indexed by the natural numbers. However, it is also possible to define random walks which take their steps at random times, and in that case, the position X
t has to be defined for all times t ∈ [0,+∞).

Various types of random walks are of interest, which can differ in several ways. The term itself most often refers to a special category of Markov chains but many time-dependent processes are referred to as random walks, with a modifier indicating their specific properties. \
A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

There are numerous properties of random walks that we may be interested in. They are listed and defined below.

**Stationary distribution** \
**Hitting time** \
**Commute time** \
**Cover time**


### Compare your finding with your applications drawing your personal conclusions.

### Explain based on your exercise the beaviour of the distribution of the stochastic process (check out "Donsker's invariance principle"). What are, in particular, its mean and variance at time n ?
