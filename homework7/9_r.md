### History and derivation of the normal distribution.

In probability theory, a normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is

The parameter μ is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode), while the parameter σ is its standard deviation. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed. The normal curve formula appears in mathematics as a limiting case of what would happen if you had an
infinite number of data points.

**Normal distribution derived as approximation of binomial** \
The person who first derived the formula, Abraham DeMoivre (1667- 1754), was solving a gambling problem whose solution depended on finding the sum of the terms of a binomial distribution. Later work, especially by Gauss about 1800, used the normal distribution to describe the pattern of random measurement error in observational data. Neither man used the name “normal curve.” That expression did not appear until the 1870s. 

The normal curve formula first appeared in a paper by DeMoivre in 1733. He wrote the 1733 paper in Latin, and in 1738 he translated it himself into English for the 2nd edition of his book, The Doctrine of Chances, one of the first textbooks on probability.

But why did DeMoivre do it? What problem was he working on? \
He was dealing with “Problems of Chance". Let's see an example of this kind of problem. \
The binomial distribution can be used to solve problems such as "If a fair coin is flipped 100 times, what is the probability of getting 60 or more heads?" The probability of exactly x heads out of N flips is computed using the formula:

where x is the number of heads (60), N is the number of flips (100), and π is the probability of a head (0.5). Therefore, to solve this problem, you compute the probability of 60 heads, then the probability of 61 heads, 62 heads, etc., and add up all these probabilities. Imagine how long it must have taken to compute binomial probabilities before the advent of calculators and computers.

Abraham de Moivre, as a consultant to gamblers, was often called upon to make these lengthy computations. de Moivre noted that when the number of events (coin flips) increased, the shape of the binomial distribution approached a very smooth curve. Binomial distributions for 2, 4, and 12 flips are shown below.

De Moivre reasoned that if he could find a mathematical expression for this curve, he would be able to solve problems such as finding the probability of 60 or more heads out of 100 coin flips much more easily. This is exactly what he did, and the curve he discovered is now called the "normal curve."

So if X is a binomial random variable then the shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities np and nq must both be greater than five (np>5  and nq>5) where p is the probability of successes, n the number of trials and q = 1-p. If so is true then the binomial can be approximated by the normal distribution with μ = np and σ = √(npq).
Mathematically this can be written as

**Normal distribution derived as error curve**\
Ceres was a planet that disappeared behind the sun before its recognition in 1801. Interest in this possibly new planet was widespread and astronomers throughout Europe prepared themselves by compu-guessing the location where Ceres was most likely to reappear. Gauss proposed that an area of the sky be searched that was quite different from those suggested by the other astronomersand he turned out to be right. Gauss explained that he used the least squares criterion to locate the orbit that bestfit the observations. This criterion was justified by a theory of errors that was based on the following three assumptions:

Small errors are more likely than large errors.
For any real number ε the likelihood of errors of magnitudes ε and −ε are equal.
In the presence of several measurements of the same quantity, the most likely value of the quantity being measured is their average.

On the basis of these assumptions he concluded that the probability density for the error (that is, the error curve) is:

where h is a positive constant that Gauss thought of as the “precision of the measurement process”. We recognize this as the bell curve determined by μ = 0 and σ = 1/√(2h).

**Normal distribution derived as limit of sum of independent r.v.'s**\
It was Laplace who first posed the problem of aggregating several observations in 1774, although his own solution led to the Laplace distribution.

On the other hand, Laplace’s result explain perfectly the Central Limit Theorem statement:

“The sum of many random variables will have an approximately normal distribution”

More specifically, where X1, …, Xn are independet and identically distributed random variables with the same arbitrary distribution, zero mean, and variance σ² and Z is their mean scaled by sqrt(n)

Then, as n increases, the probability distribution of Z will tend to the normal distribution with zero mean and variance σ².
