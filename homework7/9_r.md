### History and derivation of the normal distribution.

In probability theory, a normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is

The parameter μ is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode), while the parameter σ is its standard deviation. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed. The normal curve formula appears in mathematics as a limiting case of what would happen if you had an
infinite number of data points.

**Normal distribution derived as approximation of binomial**
The person who first derived the formula, Abraham DeMoivre (1667- 1754), was solving a gambling
problem whose solution depended on finding the sum of the terms of a binomial distribution. Later work, especially by Gauss about 1800, used the normal distribution to describe the pattern of random measurement error in observational data. Neither man used the name “normal curve.” That expression did not appear until the 1870s. 

The normal curve formula first appeared in a paper by DeMoivre in 1733. He wrote the 1733 paper in Latin, and in 1738 he translated it himself into English for the 2nd edition of his book, The Doctrine of Chances, one of the first textbooks on probability.

But why did DeMoivre do it? What problem was he working on? \
He was dealing with “Problems of Chance,” he wanted to see how likely it is that an “experiment” will produce a given outcome. The core problem for DeMoivre is to find the sum of “several” terms in a binomial expansion. DeMoivre wanted to avoid having to add up all these coefficients. He needed to describe the general shape of the distribution of the values on a line of coefficients without having to compute each one.

A clear example of this problem can be seen in the next table. Imagine that you want to find the sum of several terms in one line, say the middle two terms in line for n = 5.

But what if you want to find the sum of the middle 10 terms in the line where n = 100? A problem like this could easily come up in a game of chance. This is what he meant by “laborious.” DeMoivre wanted to avoid having to add up all these coefficients. A solution is to describe the general shape of the distribution of the values on a line of coefficients without having to compute each one. We can see what happens with a few graphs.
